Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),Muscat,Australia,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility.

Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration.

Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all.

Yao Ming 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"We can debate the pricing on Yao Ming's new reserve, but what's undeniable, by any modern standard, is the wine's excellence. A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak.

It's far softer and silkier than the winery's companion new release, the 2005 J. Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked.

The 2007 is the 16th vintage since 1960 (the previous release was 2003). It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured.

Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit.

Tenuta San Guido 2004 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),Red Blend,Italy,"The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed.

Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse.

A more tart and tropical note of passion fruit pitches in as well, along with green grapefruit spice. The aromatic spectrum is a sublimation of exotic fruit on nose and palate. The palate sustains this high-pitched balance by the purest lightening strike of zesty acidity. Even the tiniest drop of this amber liquid has the power to perfume the entire palate for minutes.

Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals.

In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions.

Yao Ming 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, cr√®me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.",Family Reserve,97,625,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Yao Ming,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Betz Family 2010 P√®re de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"As good as any P√®re de Famille to date, this brilliantly crafted wine jumps from the glass immediately with a rainbow of blue, purple and black fruits.

This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now.

Domaine Ostertag 2015 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Riesling,France,"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness‚Äîthere almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure.

Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains.

On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow.

Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT.

Shafer 2003 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves.

Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 Holzspur Pinot Noir (Thermenregion),Pinot Noir,Austria,"A very alluring mix of wintery wood smoke, slight Bourbon vanilla and fallen oak leaves crushed underfoot frames restrained notes of red fruit. There is the most seductive, barely glanced notion of elderberry. The palate is silky and dwells on the autumnal aspects of Pinot but comes with immense elegance, tender white pepper notes and a store of profound fruit.

It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022.

As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest.

Legacy 2006 Red (Alexander Valley),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft.

It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring.

It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste.",[EMPTY],96,90,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,[EMPTY],Ch√¢teau L√©oville Barton,Roger Voss,@vossroger

Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",Berncasteler Doctor Beerenauslese Goldkap,96,160,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,[EMPTY],[EMPTY],Dr. H.

Lewis 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Complex aromas of cassis, dough, espresso, bacon, and cola create instant interest. It seduces with its rich dark fruit and earth flavors, and a concentrated, suave mouthfeel. Big flavors and tannins don't quit on the long, even finish.

Merry Edwards 2013 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"From Laguna Ridge Vineyard, which surrounds the producer's winery, this bottling begs to be explored. It's beguiling from the beginning, with unexpected shots of soy, corn nuts and gamy charcuterie. Big, structured tannins support juicy flavors of black cherry and raspberry, resulting in a complex, velvety mouthfeel. Flourishes of dark chocolate and cardamom tease on the finish.",Coopersmith,96,63,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Merry Edwards,Virginie Boone,@vboone
Castell 2012 Casteller Kugelspiel Eiswein Silvaner (Franken),Silvaner,Germany,"Luscious honey, marmalade and grapefruit perfume bursts from the glass of this bristling Silvaner eiswein.

Wine & Soul 2013 Pintas Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Portugal,"This is the top wine in the Wine & Soul range from Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Ser√¥dio Borges.

Messias 1963 Colheita Tawny  (Port),Port,Portugal,"This fabulous wine comes from a legendary Vintage Port year. Aged in wood and only bottled in 2015, it is so concentrated and intense.

Schramsberg 2007 Reserve Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling Blend,US,"Made from 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, spice-tinged fruit aromas and toasted baguette complexity make a grand entrance on the nose. It then gushes bold and complex flavors, like toasted walnuts and almonds, poached pears and a touch of ginger. Although big and broad in flavor for a sparkling wine, it's very well structured and a good bet to age through 2022 or longer.",Reserve,96,120,California,North Coast,North Coast,Schramsberg,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars

Salon 1985 Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Chardonnay,France,"An enormously complex and rich wine that almost defies description. Golden apples, raisins and pears; bread, cream, vanilla, honey and nuts. The list goes on and on. Full and rich; the mousse is extremely fine and creamy-textured in the mouth.

Nickel & Nickel 2009 Martin Stelling Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish.

Foxen 2010 Sea Smoke Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Pinot Noir,US,"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious.",Sea Smoke,96,85,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Foxen,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Gramercy 2009 Lagniappe Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Syrah,US,"This has astonishing depth of flavor, with dense black fruits marbled with notes of smoked meat, clove, balsamic and an earthy flavor.

Vine Cliff 2009 16 Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"As good as the winery's regular 2009 Cabernet is, this small-production selection from the estate vineyard is even better. However, as the tannins are fierce, it's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Through the astringency shines a bright, burning core of perfectly ripe blackberries and savory black currants.

Diamond Creek 2009 Gravelly Meadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Rich and powerful, with a molten intensity, this has loads of blackberry and cherry jam flavors, yet it has a minerally earthiness that grounds it and makes it endlessly complex.

Corliss Estates 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Syrah,US,"This winery gives its wines extra years in bottle prior to release, and it pays off with powerful, muscular, densely structured that have been polished to a fine luster. This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa. It shows tremendous depth, and it could be cellared for another few years‚Äîbut why wait?",[EMPTY],96,55,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Corliss Estates,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine¬†
Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Family Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,US,"Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard.

Diamond Creek 2009 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This shows the Diamond Creek signature of dryness, mountain tannins and voluptuously ripe, concentrated fruit. It's dense in blackberry jam and cassis flavors, with firm minerality and a lush toast note from the oak. Near perfection in all of its parts, it possesses those hard-to-define qualities of balance and elegance. Wonderful as it is now, the tannins suggest aging it for many years.",Volcanic Hill,96,175,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Diamond Creek,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Ch√¢teau Trotanoy 2005  Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,"Certainly it is firm, with impressive power.

Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion 2005  Pessac-L√©ognan,Bordeaux-style White Blend,France,"Very tight and coiled, the freshness of this wine acts as a counterweight to its intense, smoky, ripe fruit flavors.

Ch√¢teau Lynch-Bages 2005  Pauillac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness.

Ch√¢teau Palmer 2005  Margaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,"Aromas of black tar, chocolate and berries lead to a wine that is so effortlessly delicious that it's easy to forget the power the Merlot gives it.

Schramsberg 2009 Tognetti Vineyard Brut Sparkling (Carneros),Sparkling Blend,US,"The winery rarely produces single-vineyard bubblies, so when they do, it's because their team believes in the bottling. And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now.

The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade.

It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak.

Bodegas Roda 2005 Cirsion  (Rioja),Tempranillo,Spain,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Cirsion,96,303,Northern Spain,Rioja,[EMPTY],Bodegas Roda,Michael Schachner,@wineschach

It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts.

The honeyed notes become more effusive with air, edging towards honeycomb and butter shortbread. Despite this richness which also illuminates the palate, the body of this vintage cr√©mant‚Äîwhich was on its lees in magnum for more than a decade‚Äîremains slender, chalky and totally pure. This 100% varietal wine is made from the oldest Chardonnay vines in Alsace, planted in 1968.

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers.

Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar.",Cor Leonis,96,175,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Moone-Tsai,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Vineyard 7&8 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute. Winemaker Luc Morlet has really hit the jackpot with this dry, spectacularly complex young wine, which will develop for at least a decade.",Estate,96,125,California,Spring Mountain District,Napa,Vineyard 7&8,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Sequoia Grove 2007 Rutherford Bench Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A stunningly beautiful Cabernet, made from the estate vineyard of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Softly tannic and dry, it shows lush flavors of green olives, black cherries, anise and smoky oak that swirl into a long, impressive finish. Drinkable now for sheer beauty, it will develop over the next decade.",Rutherford Bench Reserve,96,65,California,Rutherford,Napa,Sequoia Grove,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Cayuse 2008 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Syrah,US,"A huge wine, fat with the characteristic Cayuse funk, and accented with plenty of meaty asphalt. Potent and powerful, bursting with berries and plums, scented with the aromas of earth and sweet (not dried) herb, chicken stock and flavors that run through the same exotic range. Round and full, forward and balanced, drinking well and maybe just a bit rounder than its brethren.",En Chamberlin Vineyard,96,70,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cayuse,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine¬†
Cayuse 2008 Widowmaker Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Superb sculpture and definition in this compact and lightly funky evocation of pure Cabernet Sauvignon. The deep, dense, super ripe berry flavors are framed within a bouquet of dried herbs, pepper, mineral, astringent tannins, and a crisp mix of earth, wood and plant flavors.

Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),Sparkling Blend,US,"Don't even think about opening this brut for at least six years and probably far longer. Made from 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Noir, it's rich and full-bodied, with elaborately ripe flavors of tangerines, raspberries, roasted almonds and coconut, brioche, honey and vanilla.

Charles Smith 2008 King Coal Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,"This is the first time a King Coal has been made, all sourced from the Stoneridge Vineyard. It's a unique and delicious wine, seamless and complex. The flavors are amazingly detailed, with layer upon layer of candied fruit, raisins, Bourbon barrel, Asian spice, ginger, toast and more. The flavors pile on and continue into a seemingly endless finish, resonating into a spicy blend of fruit and Christmas cookies.",King Coal,96,100,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Charles Smith,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine¬†
Foxen 2010 Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Chardonnay,US,"You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.",Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard,96,32,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Foxen,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",Stagecoach Vineyard,96,45,California,Atlas Peak,Napa,Conn Creek,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
De Loach 2009 Pennacchio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"With the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.",Pennacchio Vineyard,96,45,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,De Loach,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Venge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6‚Äì8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.",Family Reserve,96,135,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Venge,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]

Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Ethos Late Harvest White Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),White Riesling,US,"This is just this side of unctuous, a decadently ripe and rich late harvest Riesling. The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey.

Goldschmidt 2005 Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is a densely structured young Cab. Although the tannins are  ripe and sweet, they still possess enough astringency to suggest cellaring.

Testarossa 2006 Cuv√©e Niclaire Pinot Noir (California),Pinot Noir,US,"Of all Testarossa's 2006 Pinots, this is the most complex, and also the most ageworthy. Offers a flood of cherry, red currant, Dr. Pepper, raspberry, licorice, vanilla cookie and oaky spice flavors that are fantastically intense and interesting.

Williams Selyem 2010 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity.

Mark Ryan 2011 Lonely Heart Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This bottling is quintessential Red Mountain in style, with potent aromatics of concentrated black fruits, gun metal and rock.

Kay Brothers 2012 Amery Vineyard Block 6 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Shiraz,Australia,"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in.

The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),Muscat,France,"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity.

Burmester 1952 Colheita Tawny  (Port),Port,Portugal,"This is an astonishing wine for its age. It shines with fruit and with rich toffee flavors that are balanced by acidity.

The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents.

The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed.

While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit‚Äîthink tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear‚Äîas well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate.

It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear‚Äîagain in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise.

These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance.

Chanson P√®re et Fils 2007 Domaine H√©ritiers Paul Chanson  (Corton Vergennes),Pinot Noir,France,"Rounded and fat, with the weight and power of white wines from Corton.

Loimer 2008 Langenlois Steinmassl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),Riesling,Austria,"One of Austria's great Rieslings, Loimer's Steinmassl is a wonderful, elegant and restrained statement.

Lis Neris 2007 Tal L√πc White (Friuli),White Blend,Italy,"Tal L√πc comes in an elegant little bottle that beautifully sets the stage for the fabulous dessert wine to follow. The color is deeply golden and saturated and aromas include toasted almond, dried yellow rose, candied fruit and apricot.

Sbragia 2006 Rancho Del Oso Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is the most accessible, most interesting and most compelling of Sbragia's new Cabernets.

Sbragia 2006 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish.

Knights Bridge 2007 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense.

Ruinart 2002 Dom Ruinart Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,France,"A superb, mature wine that is ripe, toasty and full of yellow- and white-fruit flavors. A fine balance brings up spice, an opulent texture, a taut edge of steel and a feeling that this fine wine is ready to drink.

Deutz 2000 Cuv√©e William Deutz  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,France,"Deutz's top cuv√©e is as good as ever. Bottle aging has helped it to throw off its youthful awakwardness and develop a rounded, ripe style that is now a pleasure to drink.

W.H. Smith 2010 Maritime Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,US,"The Maritime bottling traditionally has represented some of the highest expressions of W.H. Smith's various Pinot Noirs. Gentle and yet complex, it opens with notes of raspberries and cherries accented with mushrooms and minerals.

Diamond Creek 2010 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030.",Red Rock Terrace,95,200,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Diamond Creek,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Louis Roederer 2006 Cristal Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,France,"Although it is still young, this vintage of Cristal promises great things. There's an impressive balance between ripe fruit and crisp acidity, rich and food friendly, but also a fine ap√©ritif.

Robert Mondavi 2011 Fum√© Blanc (Oakville),Fum√© Blanc,US,"This isn't Mondavi's most expensive Fum√© (Sauvignon) Blanc. But it is one of their best ever. In fact, it's so classic, you could use it in a winemaking class to teach future vintners about how great Napa Sauvignon Blanc should taste. It's bone dry, brilliantly crisp with acidity and gently touched by oak. The main notes are of lees, which give a sourdough tang, and layers of lemons, limes, pink grapefruits, gooseberries and rich tropical fruits.

Girard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.",[EMPTY],95,75,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Girard,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Beaulieu Vineyard 2005 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent.

Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets.

The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet.

David Arthur 2010 Elevation 1147' Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Here we have a fascinating wine that's elegant and opulent, massive and controlled, flattering yet elusive, all at once. That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage.

The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star. They suggest stone-driven minerals, Meyer lemons, limes, white peaches, pink grapefruits and a savory, umami-rich note of figs.

Displaying a deep straw, slightly tawny hue, it opens with lightly spicy, nuanced threads of mint, hay, olive oil, green banana and almond.

Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,France,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance.

Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),Red Blend,US,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time.

There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace.

Ch√¢teau Latour 2009 Les Forts de Latour  (Pauillac),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,"Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend.

In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning.

Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Gerard's Blend Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Chardonnay,US,"This is so dry, minerally and richly complex, you'd swear you were drinking great French Chablis. Brisk acidity and a steely stoniness give the apricot and citrus fruits a backbone of iron and iodine. Oak is there, but subtly lurking in the background, lending a hint of buttered toast.

K Vintners 2008 The Creator Red (Washington),Red Blend,US,"This edition of The Creator is a one-time only mix of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon from Stoneridge, 21% Cabernet from Cailloux, and 36% Syrah from Morrison Lane.

Drinking perfectly now, it's a soft, smooth sipper, with lush flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar. The addition of Merlot brings a soft, mellowed mouthfeel.

Ravenswood 2008 Old Hill Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),Zinfandel,US,"A tremendous Zinfandel, Ravenswood's most expensive, and while you might quiver at the price, it's easily a very great wine. This is Zinfandel on steroids, a monster of wild summer berry, tobacco, currant and spice flavors, wrapped into significantly thick tannins.

Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

F X Pichler 2006 Loibner Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,Austria,"The extreme eastern vineyard of the Wachau is a stony valley, giving an extreme wine, all mineral and cool, poised fruit even in a warm year like 2006.

Thomas Fogarty 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),Chardonnay,US,"From one of the preeminent Chardonnay producers in the country comes their least expensive yet perhaps most stunning bottling, showing strong lemon rind, sea salt, Gravenstein apple and a floral touch of honeysuckle on the nose.

Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose.

How this can have all the fragrant promise of the coast when it is from landlocked Austria is anyone's guess.

It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of saut√©ed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood.

Trefethen 2007 HaLo Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A bit difficult to approach now, this has tight tannins that lock down the wine with astringency. Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout.

Moss Wood 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,"Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness.

Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Proven√ßal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins.

Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed‚Äîquite exquisite in its wildness.

It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries.

Ramey 2012 Pedregal Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"The producer's highest-end bottling, this is tightly wound in fine-grained tannins with complex, diverse undertones of chocolate mocha, cherry-vanilla, black tea and garrigue.

F X Pichler 2013 Loibner Burgstall Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,Austria,"Musky, heady notes of ripeness move within the pear scent of this serious Federspiel. Their richness is countered by grapefruit peel that gives verve and nerve to the entire wine, corsetting its ripeness with delicious citric acidity. There is a phenolic dimension, too, but that fizzling citrus freshness is just so much fun. This will stay fresh and exciting for a long time.

Gary Farrell 2013 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling.

Robert Biale 2013 R.W. Moore Vineyard Zinfandel (Coombsville),Zinfandel,US,"From a vineyard east of Napa first planted in 1905, Moore is densely structured and deceptively elegant, all while maintaining an intensity of tart cherry and wild blackberry.

Moone-Tsai 2009 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit.

True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated.

Terra Valentine 2008 Marriage Red (Spring Mountain District),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,"A best-of-barrels blend from the classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is delicious. It's not hard for Napa to ripen fruit to blackberry and cherry perfection, or for the winemaker to age the wine in the best oak.

Cascading flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are drenched in caramel, mocha and buttery barrel flavors. Although the wine lists at a hefty 14.9% alcohol, it does not sacrifice elegance, nor does it substitute power for polish.

Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk.

It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak.

The lemon notes become even more fully expressed on the taut but full, streamlined but expressive and dry body: they take the rich guise of lemon oil and candied peel. They are utterly tart and fresh but with that golden ripeness at their very core that makes this rather seductive. Taste buds just want to get to the bottom of this and rejoice in the purity and fruity tang. This is translucent and refreshing but also rich and full of delicious lemony vigor.

Betz Family 2010 La C√¥te Patriarche Syrah (Yakima Valley),Syrah,US,"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character, with a mix of blue and purple berry, a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense.

Constant 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),Cabernet Franc,US,"One of the best Napa Cabernet Francs in memory, this shows lush, concentrated flavors of cherry pie, red currant, mocha, anise and smoky, spicy sandalwood that are wrapped into firm but exceptionally refined tannins. Drink now to experience the youthful beauty.",[EMPTY],94,130,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Constant,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Signorello 2009 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",Padrone,94,145,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Signorello,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",Cask 23 Estate,94,210,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 FAY Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity.

K Vintners 2009 En Cerise Ovide Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,US,"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes.

K Vintners 2009 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Syrah,US,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace.

Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Vintage VI Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, cr√®me de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar.

Cre≈ç 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors.

Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together.

Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the ‚Äúiron fist in a velvet glove‚Äù description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron.

Krupp Brothers 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region, and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe, complex flavors.

Hewitt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak.

Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),Viognier,US,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard.

It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities.

Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit.

It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them.

Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Chardonnay,US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak.

As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak.

You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10‚Äì20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak.

The fruit is exceptional‚Äîdense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way.

It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor.

It was 100% whole-cluster fermented with wild yeast and aged in all neutral barrels.

Cullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),Chardonnay,Australia,"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate.

In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness.

It's a bit acidic and tannic now, the result of this cool vintage, but time in the bottle should soften and resolve the tartness and astringency.

Duckhorn 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Here's one for the cellar, no doubt about it. Shows classic, old-fashioned Howell tannins, the kind that grip early and lock the palate down throughout. But you can't help but be struck by the immensity of fruit.

It's a pleasure to drink a Merlot that's not a fruit bomb. That doesn't mean you won't find complex flavors of blackberries and currants. You will.

Castello di Verduno 2004 Monvigliero Riserva  (Barolo),Nebbiolo,Italy,"Although this Riserva already has six years of age, it opens with surprisingly bright and youthful tones of cherry, blackberry and cassis.

Poderi Elia 2007 Serracapelli  (Barbaresco),Nebbiolo,Italy,"This outlier wine sparked much controversy at the Nebbiolo blind tastings because of the thickness of its extraction and the darkness of its appearance.

Stevens 2007 XY Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting.

Freestone 2007 Pastorale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar.

Jean-Marc Brocard 2014 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),Chardonnay,France,"This vineyard is regarded as the finest of the Grand Crus, certainly for its more serious character. This 2014 has great complexity, toast and spice mingling with the mineral and white-fruit flavors. It is obviously set for long-term aging with its wood still not fully integrated.

Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,France,"The Devillards own 99% of this 8.5-acre Premier Cru and so feel they can describe it as a quasi-monopoly.

Foxen 2014 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Pinot Noir,US,"Quite light in the glass, this bottling offers a strongly sage-driven nose bolstered by light licorice and chipped slate that's laced through the tangy cranberry and pretty red-cherry aromas.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Foxen,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
Henri Bourgeois 2014 Sancerre d'Antan Terroir de Silex  (Sancerre),Sauvignon Blanc,France,"Oak aging and no filtration give this beautiful wine richness and dense texture.

Notre Vin 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding. Feels ultrarich on the palate now, and should ride out the next decade with ease.",[EMPTY],94,150,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Notre Vin,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley),Sparkling Blend,US,"This is one of the greatest Carneros sparkling wines in memory.

Testarossa 2008 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pinot Noir,US,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar.

De Sante 2006 Oakville Terraces Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A terrific Cabernet marked by the superbly ripe, fine tannins and classic blackberry and black currant fruit Napa so routinely delivers.

D.R. Stephens 2006 Estate Moose Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy. Let all the elements battle it out for a good six years.

Hunnicutt 2006 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate. Most exquisite are the tannins, so pure and refined.

Jean-Luc Bald√®s 2007 Clos Triguedina The New Black Wine Malbec (Cahors),Malbec,France,"Prunes and dark chocolate, rather than fresh fruits, dominate this dark-hued wine.

Kent Rasmussen 2007 Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rutherford),Petite Sirah,US,"Very dry and tannic, as Petite Sirah should be. But unlike many ‚ÄúPets,‚Äù it's also balanced and elegant. The official alcohol is only 13.5%, yet there's not a trace of greenness. In fact, the wine, which has plenty of French oak, is quite rich in blackberry and black currant flavors. Really a superb example, a Petite Sirah for Cabernet fans. Should evolve interestingly for many years.",Esoterica Chavez-Leeds Vineyard,94,40,California,Rutherford,Napa,Kent Rasmussen,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Alienor 2006 Grand Vin Red (Lake County),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,"A beautiful wine that will redefine the way you view Lake County.

D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale),Riesling,Australia,"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish.

Telmo Rodr√≠guez 2009 Altos Lanzaga  (Rioja),Tempranillo,Spain,"The last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic.

This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability.

Mt. Brave 2009 Malbec (Mount Veeder),Malbec,US,"Amazingly rich and voluptuous, this shows none of the rustic edges that can sometimes plague Malbec. It's concentrated in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, with a jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is high, but not overbearing.

Qup√© 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard X Block The Good Nacido Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),Syrah,US,"This bottling is the winery's most expensive wine, and usually its best. Production of the '08 was unusually low, resulting in amazing concentration. It's basically a detonation of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and mocha. New oak is present, in the form of delicate toast and wood spice, but is balanced. So silky and delicious now, you can drink it, but the tannic balance suggests the cellar.

Lush and smooth as velvet, it shows enormously deep, ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, leather, cola, soy-splashed Portobello, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors.

The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean.

This wine, with its long term future, is still young, showing as much tannin as fruit, so don't drink before 2016.",L'Ame,94,[EMPTY],Southwest France,Gaillac,[EMPTY],Domaine Rotier,Roger Voss,@vossroger
Amici 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Winemaker Joel Aiken was lucky enough to source fruit from this famous Napa Valley appellation, and its mountain origins show in both the intensity of flavors and of tannins. The fruit is remarkably concentrated in cassis, with a tangy minerality that must come from the soil. New French oak, with its tannins and sweet toast, has been perfectly applied. The wine is vital, harmonious and young. Give it 10 or 15 years to begin to come around.",[EMPTY],94,125,California,Spring Mountain District,Napa,Amici,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Testarossa 2011 Dos Rubios Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pinot Noir,US,"This is certainly one of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs. The winery purchases most of its fruit, but in this case, the vineyard is co-owned by Testarossa, and winemaker Bill Brosseau had complete control in the vineyard. The wine is gorgeous, complex and ageable. Beyond the exquisite raspberry and blueberry fruit is a mineral-derived savoriness that makes it firm in the mouth. Gorgeous now, this single-vineyard wine should age well for at least 12 years.",Dos Rubios Vineyard,94,60,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Testarossa,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Turnbull 2010 Pierra Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"All the individual parts of this 100% Cabernet are, in a word, gargantuan. Yet somehow the wine maintains its balance. The fruit is unbelievably ripe and powerful, with black currants, plums and chocolate that veer into a slight, Port-like finish. The tannins are thick and mellow, while oak adds rich notes of caramel. The result is a stupendously lush, delicious and heady wine. Hold for up to 15 years.",Pierra,94,260,California,Oakville,Napa,Turnbull,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Ch√¢teau Haut-Monplaisir 2010 Pur Plaisir Malbec (Cahors),Malbec,France,"This firm Malbec comes from old vines. It is concentrated and dense, while wearing its power easily and openly.

Ch√¢teau La Nerthe 2010 Cuv√©e des Cadettes Red (Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape),Rh√¥ne-style Red Blend,France,"La Nerthe's Cuv√©e des Cadettes shows a bit of oak on the nose in its hints of vanilla and toasted coconut, but also copious amounts of raspberry fruit. It's full bodied and lush, with the fruit gently cosseted by oak, not at all overwhelmed, and the finish is long and plushly textured.

Nickel & Nickel 2010 Martin Stelling Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"The price on this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is premium, but be assured, it's an excellent wine, just not necessarily one for drinking now, since the tannins need time to soften. Judging by the intense core of blackberries and cassis, as well as the overall balance, it's a wine that will age for a long time.

Testarossa 2011 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Pinot Noir,US,"If the first duty of a wine is to offer pleasure, then this wildly succeeds. It shows the power of great Santa Rita Pinot, with superb balancing elegance. As sweet as the raspberries and licorice seem, the wine finishes dry and crisp in acidity, and even with some bracing tannins.

Turnbull 2010 Estate Grown Syrah (Oakville),Syrah,US,"What a fine Syrah this is. It's the color of midnight on a moonless night, with just a hint of ruby purple at the rim. The aromatics are closed, but provide tantalizing hints of cedar, jam and pepper. It's in the mouth that this young wine shows its stuff, erupting with sweet chocolate, intensely ripe blackberries and savory smoked meat. The tannins close in on the finish, suggesting that the wine needs time. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2016.",Estate Grown,94,42,California,Oakville,Napa,Turnbull,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Au Bon Climat 2010 Isabelle Pinot Noir (California),Pinot Noir,US,"The California appellation is because this Pinot is a blend of vineyards from Anderson Valley, Russian River Valley and the Central Coast. Few vintners dare to take such an approach, especially with so expensive a wine, but Jim Clendenen succeeds wildly. The wine is bone dry, low in alcohol and tart in acidity, with crazily complex flavors of cherries, cranberries, pomegranates, cola, orange peel and spices.

Cayuse 2011 Cailloux Vineyard Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Viognier,US,"This vintage marks a welcome return of Viognier to the otherwise all-red Cayuse portfolio. It's an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity.

Testarossa 2011 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pinot Noir,US,"This single-vineyard wine feels light and silky in the mouth, like the passing of a cloud. Yet incredibly ripe cherry, raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors give it weight and importance, making it sweetly delicious. Brilliant acidity provides balance, suggesting pairing it with barbecued steak. But there's also as guarantee foraging as you can get in a California Pinot Noir.

Boekenhoutskloof 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Auction Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Franschhoek),Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,"Winemaker: Marc Kent. Though perhaps better known for his classic Boekenhoutskloof Syrah or Semillon, do NOT underestimate the power and beauty of Marc Kent's Cabernet. This is a real stunner, packed full of well-balanced and -composed power that suggests this is a wine indented for the long haul. It's loaded with ripe, dense black-fruit aromas and flavors, expressed in waves of black plum, berry and cherry that are accented by pleasant hints of green pepper, licorice root and charred bark. It's bold and firmly structured on the palate, with robust tannins that linger long on the chewy, cigar-box spiced finish.

Paul Cluver 2016 Cape Winemakers Guild The Wagon Trail Chardonnay (Elgin),Chardonnay,South Africa,"Winemaker: Andries Burger. Always a stunner, the 2016 Wagon Trail delivers impeccable balance, freshness and minerality that can easily translate in the wine being mistaken for one from another iconic Old World Chardonnay region, and probably at about five times the price. It's decadently ripe and toasty, with present yet refined notes of baked apple, lemon meringue and toasted hazelnut that leave you begging for more. The rich mouthfeel is immediately countered by superb, bright acidity and stony minerality before veering back into notes of toasted brioche and spiced citrus peel on the endless finish.

It is only made in exceptional years, and 2012 was certainly among the best in memory. Berry, cherry and toast components are here in full measure, with a sumptuous mocha-infused finish.

Robert Craig 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"An awesome Cabernet, as deep and dramatic as they come. It shows the incredibly concentrated blackberry and cassis fruit of Howell Mountain, along with firm tannins.

The aromatic effect is one of huge generosity. The palate, on the other hand, is taut and medium dry, corralling its richness with pleasantly bitter texture and pervading freshness.

Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones.

Pride Mountain 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma-Napa),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar.

PharaohMoans 2007 Westside Red (Paso Robles),Rh√¥ne-style Red Blend,US,"This Rh√¥ne blend from the fashionable west side of Paso Robles is made in the modern cult style. It's very dark in color, full-bodied and glyceriney in the mouth, and delivers a thermonuclear blast of fruit and oak. Among the flavors are roasted blackberries, cassis, melted milk chocolate, anise, cotton candy, vanilla custard, cr√®me br√ªl√©e and cinnamon spice. Not exactly your classically dry table wine.

The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious.

Testarossa 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"Testarossa has an incredible track record with Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and in 2007, they've produced as fine a wine as they've ever done.

Tegernseerhof 2008 Steinertal Riesling (Wachau),Riesling,Austria,"An impressive wine that manages to bring out both richness and a wonderful shower of fresh flavors.

Terre Rouge 2006 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),Syrah,US,"This is Terre Rouge's priciest Syrah, a barrel selection of the best lots. It's a big wine. No, make that huge. Godzilla-esque. Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper.

Andrew Will 2005 Sorella Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Red Blend,US,"The Sorella is deep and dense with thick textures and tannins.

Paul Jaboulet A√Æn√© 1999 La Chapelle  (Hermitage),Rh√¥ne-style Red Blend,France,"Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.",La Chapelle,94,131,Rh√¥ne Valley,Hermitage,[EMPTY],Paul Jaboulet A√Æn√©,Roger Voss,@vossroger

Delas Fr√®res 1999 Les Bessards  (Hermitage),Rh√¥ne-style Red Blend,France,"Old vines in the Les Bessards vineyard on the Hermitage hill have offered up a majestic wine that has considerable power. With its strong, firm tannins and intense, brooding dark fruits, this is a wine that has obviously been made to last.

Ch√¢teau Montrose 2006  Saint-Est√®phe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,"Yes, this wine is tannic. To begin with it seems austere and mineral. But then the substrate of black berry juice asserts itself. The fruits are fresh rather than sweet, combining with leather, spice and a presence of new wood.

The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years.

Siduri 2007 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pinot Noir,US,"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard.

Mercy 2008 Cedar Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),Pinot Noir,US,"An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor.

Bergstr√∂m 2009 de Lancellotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Pinot Noir,US,"A concentrated core of pure, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit is showcased in a wine of remarkable penetration and length. The fruit, from a biodynamic estate vineyard, is perfumed and open, making this immediately accessible and supremely enjoyable.

Couloir 2010 Monument Tree Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Pinot Noir,US,"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness.

De Loach 2009 Nova Vineyard Zinfandel (Lake County),Zinfandel,US,"De Loach reaches into Lake County, not usually thought of as Zinfandel country, with tremendous results. This is a great wine by any standard. It shows some heat from high alcohol and some shriveled raisin tastes, but that's part of a ripe Zin's charm.

Niepoort 1986 Colheita  (Port),Port,Portugal,"Gold in color, this is a wood-aged Port. Despite being 26 years old, it is still lively, almost fruity.

Notre Vin 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate.

Raymond 2008 Generations Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure.

Frazier 2008 Memento Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Memento,94,110,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Frazier,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]

Niepoort 1984 Colheita  (Port),Port,Portugal,"Now that the color of this superb wine has gone to old gold, it has definitely become a gloriously mature Port.

Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),Chardonnay,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay, bone dry and crisp in acidity. Almost lean in citrus and mineral flavors, but on further inspection shows complex layers of toast, honeysuckle, peach and stone, with a deft touch of new oak. Feels weighty and important, and finishes wonderfully dry.",Rosemary's Vineyard,94,46,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,Talley,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Babcock 2009 Upper Crust Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),Syrah,US,"The real deal in a cool-climate Syrah. Dark and broodingly dry, it smells like grilled lamb, roasted rosemary, white pepper and other Proven√ßal herbs, blackberries, cassis and smoky oak. High in alcohol but balanced, this 100% varietal wine is huge, powerful, dramatic and tannic. Drink it soon with the best grilled meats.",Upper Crust,94,50,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Babcock,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
I Giusti e Zanza 2007 Dulcamara Red (Toscana),Red Blend,Italy,"This gorgeous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot offers beautiful intensity and impressive complexity. Aromas here include black cherry, exotic spice, leather, fine tobacco and loads of plush, ripe fruit. It's a smooth velvety wine but the tannic backbone gives it lift and staying power.",Dulcamara,94,[EMPTY],Tuscany,Toscana,[EMPTY],I Giusti e Zanza,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,US,"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of pine, cola, wintergreen, anise, bacon and smoky, sweet vanillins from oak barrels. A wine of great pedigree, it's showing well now, and should hold for the next six years.",Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve,94,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Fort Ross,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Wallis Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Rich, elaborate and layered. If this Cab were a fabric, it would be suede. Shows the tannins and minerals of Diamond Mountain, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, anise and sweet smoky oak. The finish is wonderfully dry, firm and long. Should develop for at least eight years.",[EMPTY],94,65,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Wallis Family Estate,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Franz Hirtzberger 2010 Honivogl Smaragd Gr√ºner Veltliner (Wachau),Gr√ºner Veltliner,Austria,"Gorgeously ripe fruit, full of pear, green plum and exotic spices.

Keenan 2007 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),Merlot,US,"Just delicious, an important, elegant Merlot to drink with the finest steaks and chops. Even better than the fine 2006, with vast, deep flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cocoa, grilled meat and herbs, wrapped into rich, smooth tannins. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink over the next six years.",Reserve Mailbox Vineyard,94,60,California,Spring Mountain District,Napa,Keenan,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Monteviejo 2007 Lindaflor La Violeta Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Argentina,"Dark and incredibly concentrated, with earth, black fruits, mint and exotic side notes. It's stout and tannic, but also rich and pure, with monster black fruit flavor and powerful coffee, toast and length on the finish. A smashing wine that's huge but delicious. Drink now through 2017.",Lindaflor La Violeta,94,100,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,[EMPTY],Monteviejo,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
Vall Llach 2006 Red (Priorat),Red Blend,Spain,"Earthy and deep as midnight, with spice, floral notes, herbal aromas, tobacco and mocha. The palate is super rich, almost to the point of syrupy, with blackberry, brown sugar and coffee flavors. Finishes chewy, ripe and deep, with no harshness or tannic grind. Drink now through 2013.",[EMPTY],94,95,Catalonia,Priorat,[EMPTY],Vall Llach,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
Castello Banfi 2007 Summus Red (Toscana),Red Blend,Italy,"Summus is a beautiful Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that opens with a drying, dusty mineral feel followed by loads of plump, ripe fruit.

Sheldon 2009 Ripken Vineyard Graciano (Lodi),Graciano,US,"This might be one of the most interesting wines being made in California right now, a tiny production, 12%-alcohol Graciano, a grape native to Rioja and barely found in California. The wine is bright and very European, full of white pepper, cranberry and leather notes, high in acid and very clean, though it's unfined and unfiltered. It lasts and lasts, getting better with every drop.",Ripken Vineyard,94,48,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Sheldon,Virginie Boone,@vboone
Clendenen 2003 Brico Buon Natale Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley),Nebbiolo,US,"One of the best Nebbiolos to ever come from California. The aroma dazzles with notes of tar, licorice, roasted meat, cherries, pepper and cedar. The wine is absolutely dry, with brilliant acidity, and seems to change with each moment in the glass. Just starting to dry out, but still fresh and lively. A remarkable wine at an amazingly affordable price for what you get.",Brico Buon Natale,94,35,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Clendenen,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Franz Hirtzberger 2010 Rotes Tor Smaragd Gr√ºner Veltliner (Wachau),Gr√ºner Veltliner,Austria,"Intensely mineral wine, with an austere edge of acidity and texture.

Hall 2008 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"This is a best of barrels blend from Hall's various vineyards, including the famous Sacrashe. The wine itself is lovely. It has a firm structure thanks to dusty tannins and a dry minerality, while bright acidity makes the cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit sing. Drink now and through 2014.",Kathryn Hall,94,90,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Hall,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Palmeri 2005 Van Ness Vineyard Syrah (Alexander Valley),Syrah,US,"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak. There's a purity to the complex waves of blackberries, currants, Canadian bacon, dried herbs, black pepper and sandalwood, with a minerally tang that must come from the soil. Wonderful now, this great Syrah should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.",Van Ness Vineyard,94,53,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Palmeri,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Alta Vista 2006 Single Vineyard Temis Malbec (Uco Valley),Malbec,Argentina,"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes.

Best wine from Alta Vista to date.",Single Vineyard Temis,94,50,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,[EMPTY],Alta Vista,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
Bjornstad 2007 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Chardonnay,US,"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla cr√®me br√ªl√©e, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",Ritchie Vineyard,94,40,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Bjornstad,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
Cascina Ballarin 2005 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo),Nebbiolo,Italy,"Cascina Ballarin's Barolo Bricco Rocca comes from the La Morra area of the Langhe and offers intense aromas of blue flower, violets, almond flowers, cinnamon and powdered licorice.

Rubicon Estate 2006 Red (Rutherford),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,"The new Rubicon, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, brings to mind the 2003 and 2004. It doesn't have the sheer force of 2002 or 2005, but it's certainly a classic Rutherford wine, and has a good future. Bone dry, it shows herb-infused flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and smoky sandalwood, and yes, the tannins are dusty. Drinkable now, with a good decant, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6‚Äì8 years.",[EMPTY],94,145,California,Rutherford,Napa,Rubicon Estate,[EMPTY],[EMPTY]
E. Pira e Figli (Chiara Boschis) 2005 Cannubi  (Barolo),Nebbiolo,Italy,"Vintner Chiara Boschis took over this historic estate after the death of its founder Luigi Pira.

Stift G√∂ttweig 2012 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),Riesling,Austria,"Seductive notes of fragrant, red-cheeked peaches come together with notes of honeysuckle.

Allram 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),Riesling,Austria,"A pure and spicy lift of bergamot promises refreshment while the palate whirls with peach, mandarin and blood orange.
